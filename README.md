# anti-burglary-alert
This system is to safeguard your home from unwarranted thefts and intrusions in your absence.
The idea is to use the  ultrasonic sensor  to check the proximity of the intruder when the light is not present (ie, in a dark room) and buzz the alarm if the intruder happens to come too close, as well send an alert to the owner of the house, warning them about the intruder.
# The system uses :
   - Ultrasonic sensor
   - RGB led
   - Arduino Uno
   - Buzzer
   - LDR
